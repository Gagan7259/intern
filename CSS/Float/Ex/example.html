            <p>Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all
                of which are made of rock and metal. Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name
                does not come from Greek or Roman mythology.</p>

        <p>The name "Earth" is an English derivation which came from the older Urth. And is only used by Anglophonic
            peoples. The Greeks called our planet Terra ( which is the name science uses to universally refer to our
            planet) and certain others call it Gaia. The French called our planet Monde, the Germans Erde.</p>
            
            <p>To make the highest possible impact on the climate and biodiversity crises between now and 2030, weâ€™re
                developing breakthrough ideas, amplifying local leaders and influencing policy.</p>
